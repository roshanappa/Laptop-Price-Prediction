In this project I have used the Streamlit web app in order to get the end to end machine learning.There are several laptops inside the data along with their configuration and price so I have decided go forewards with all the major steps in order to predict the price of the laptop and somehow I am able to the R2  is equal to 89% ,It can be increase by using further feature engineering like hyperparameter Tunning. Thank You !!
